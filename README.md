# EdiReader

An Elixir wrapper for EdiReader(https://github.com/BerryWorksSoftware/edireader) using [Jinterface](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/jinterface/jinterface_users_guide.html).

Work was inspired by [`Diver`](https://github.com/novabyte/diver)

## Installation

by adding `edi_reader` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
